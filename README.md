# Early-diabetes-detection-using-classification
Machine learning project for early detection of diabetes using supervised classification algorithms (KNN, Decision Tree, Logistic Regression, SVM). Includes dataset preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and predictions.
ðŸ©º Early Detection of Diabetes using Supervised Classification

This project focuses on predicting the likelihood of diabetes at an early stage using **machine learning supervised classification algorithms**.  
The goal is to help in early diagnosis and prevention planning by building a reliable prediction model.
